## BCDC Data Curation Help

This is the page for help documents and resources for BICCN data submitters. Use the following links to navigate to important documents and tools that are needed for submitting data and metadata to the BICCN.


### Overall Process

Our goals for Data Curation at the BCDC are:

* Building the [BICCN Data Catalog](https://knowledge.brain-map.org/data?fprogram.title=BRAIN%20Initiative%20Cell%20Census%20Network) as a key point of access and valuable resource for users
* Coordinating with the data archives to maintain an updated database of all BICCN specimens for NIH grant reporting purposes.

The BICCN Data Catalog is organized into **Projects** that have one or many associated **Data Collections**. Data Collections
consist of a collection of **Specimens** that have data assets at the archives. 

#### Project and Data Collection Metadata

***DEFINE project and data collection, in our terms

- General grant and dataset level metadata, E.g. Text descriptions of datasets, Protocols, Licensing, Contributors, Institutions, Funding
- This is recorded when registering new projects, so that BCDC can plan for what data we will have coming in
- Project and Data Collection metadata is displayed on the landing pages in the BCDC Data Catalog [SCREENSHOT pointing to relevant fields on Data Catalog page]

#### Specimen Metadata 

***DEFINE specimen (examples by modality)

- This is individual sample and file level metadata, E.g. Species, Genotype, Age, Specimen Type, File Type 
- These metadata are displayed on Specimen pages in the BCDC Catalog, and are also used for searching/filtering the data
- Manifest of files for each specimen at archives, with file metadata including type, PID at archive , URI
- also main audit of all data collected by BICCN, for reconciliation with archives and reporting outputs to NIH

### Project and Data Collection Registration

Projects and their associated data collections are registered at BCDC at the start of the grant/project. **New data
collections must be registered with BCDC before submitting data to the relevant archives.** 
For this, you will need to fill out a project/data collection template and submit this to the BCDC Data Curation team. Contact 
the Data Curation team to guide you through the process of registering your project and associated data collections.

### File Manifests



### Controlled Vocabularies and Ontologies

As part of our commitment to following community standards in curating BICCN data, BCDC uses controlled vocabularies and ontologies for metadata.
